About Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data and makes predictions based on that data.
2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

Applications of NLP
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering systems

Vector Databases
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are crucial for applications like similarity search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Popular vector databases include:
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Chroma
- Milvus

Retrieval Augmented Generation
RAG is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses. This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, grounded answers.

The RAG pipeline typically involves:
1. Document ingestion and chunking
2. Embedding generation
3. Vector storage and indexing
4. Query embedding
5. Similarity search
6. Context augmentation
7. Response generation with citations
